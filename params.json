Being an international student I know how cultural background can change the way you think. I have personally experienced this and always had a question about how human behavior can be influenced by the culture or the upbringing of a person.\r\nWhile growing up and learning Indian history, I found the relation how a doctor’s son will be doctor or how children follow or are supposed to follow what their ancestors did. Eventually, development and evolving led people to choose different trades and the pattern changed over time. This analysis can help us understand how ethnicity of a person can lead to change in choosing education and the patterns in it. This can allow us to understand the reasons behind the human behavior. Example Asians are more leaned to choose science, engineering or mathematical trades. Is this because of the culture, environment or the job opportunities available around or anatomy of the brain - that they are good in specific area? There can be many different reasons and to start looking for answers, one can start from analyzing the relationship between Ethnicity and education one chooses to help solve these mysteries.\r\n\r\n###Objective of the analysis:\r\n\r\nTo learn about the diverse population around the campus\r\nTo visualize the Ethnicity patterns \r\nTo study the pattern respect to the level of studies and departments\r\nTo analyze the relationship between the ethnicity and the trade \r\n\r\n\r\n### Data sources\r\nI have received the data from the Office of Institutional Research department of University of Minnesota. The U policy on student data privacy does not allow to share the records with ethnicity head count below 5. So this data represents and approximate visualization and can be used as a general reference map. \r\n\r\nThe department information is received from Facility management, UServices.  This data consist of the department information like OBJECTID,Dept_by_building_BUILDING,Dept_by_building_DEPTID,Dept_by_building_DEPT_DESC,\r\nStructure_Footprint_CAMPUS_NUMBER,Structure_Footprint_BUILDING_NUMBER,Structure_Footprint_NAME,\r\nStructure_Footprint_NAME_ABBREV,Structure_Footprint_NAME_ALTERNATE,Structure_Footprint_ADDRESS1,\r\nStructure_Footprint_ADDRESS2,Structure_Footprint_CITY,Structure_Footprint_STATE,Structure_Footprint_ZIP,\r\nStructure_Footprint_SITE_BLDG,Structure_Footprint_ACCESSIBLE_YN,Structure_Footprint_MAP_URL_SMALL,\r\nStructure_Footprint_MAP_URL_LARGE,Structure_Footprint_GOOGLEMAP_URL,Structure_Footprint_BLDGPAGE_URL,\r\nStructure_Footprint_BLDG_PHOTO_URL,Structure_Footprint_Shape_Length,Structure_Footprint_Shape_Area,\r\nStructure_Footprint_X,Structure_Footprint_Y.\r\n\r\nI have selected Cartodb as the web mapping platform. I considered using ArcGIS online as well, however I was able to get more animations in Cartodb than ArcGIS online. \r\n\r\n### Joining the data wasn't easy\r\n\r\nBring this two different data sets together was not an easy task. As the structure footprint layer of university only consists of the building information represented in polygons and not the department level spatial information. I had to create points for each building and its related departments.  I tried to automate the process using create random points but this didn't allow me get the related information. It created points but didn't have any information other than object id, which was not useful at all. So finally I digitized the data in ArcMap and got a department level footprints.\r\n\r\nDepartment data allows to spatially represent the ethnicity data. I have used building footprints layer to spatially locate the departments. Some departments do not have specific location due to privacy policies so those are placed to the relevant locations.\r\n\r\n![deaprtments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/Departments.PNG)\r\n \r\nNow this department point features had to be further divided into Ethnicity. This filed consisted for 8 coded values as given below.\r\n\r\n![legend](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/legend.PNG)\r\n\r\nThis meant diving those departments further into 8, each ethnicity information is associated with the headcount. This sounds simple but the ethnicity data consisted for different levels like Grad, Undergrad, Professional, Non degree. This whole data set was for three years. After cleaning the whole data set for days I finally got a Ethnicity department level point layer as shown below consisting of 1976 records of department level ethnicity.\r\n\r\n![Ethnicity layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/Ethnicity.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe final web map is developed in Cartodb, the layers in the map are Yearly Department level ethnicity (layer is time enabled), Ethnicity data (simple map), Ethnicity heat map. Both layers except the time enabled layer have pop ups with information regarding the building, department, Ethnicity, term, head count, buildings detail page and a photo. Some of the snap shots of the map are given below:\r\n\r\n![Snap1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/Capture.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n![Snap2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/Capture1.PNG)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion: \r\n\r\nThe data analysis shows the following results for 2013 – 2015 which depicts some patterns like international students going for Grad studies as compared to other. Black ethnicity students going for undergrads more compared to grad studies. Hispanic population more in undergrad compared to other level of education etc. These results can further be categorized for detail of the ethnicity pattern. This study is not for racially discriminating any ethnic group but to know the reasons and to bring in resources to the students of particular ethnicity. This also allows us to understand the diverse culture of university and how university can help students to learn more about different cultures which would help them understand and respect different ethnicity.\r\n\r\nThe data analysis shows the following results for 2013 - 2015\r\n\r\n![excel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sangl003/Umn-ethnicity/gh-pages/images/Capt1.PNG)\r\n\r\n###Future scope: \r\n\r\nThe departments can further be bifurcated in categories like Arts, science, engineering, Commerce, Human resources etc. This will allow us to aggregate the students in these different areas according to the ethnicity and give broader perspective of the education trades some ethnicity are leaned towards. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFor more information you can contact me on Github @sangl003 or @ sangl003@umn.edu\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
